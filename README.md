# multiplication_of_2_increasing_num.py

- This is a program that asks for users input of x & y, then asks for inputs for how much they are to be increased each time, then the sum of x and the increase is                 multiplied by the sum of y and its continues for however many times the user wants the calculation to be performed. It will then print the total time taken, and the             inputted values.
