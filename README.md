# multiplication_of_2_increasing_num.py

- This is a program that asks for users input of x & y, then asks for inputs for how much they are to be increased each time, then the sum of x and the increase is                 multiplied by the sum of y and its continues for however many times the user wants the calculation to be performed. It will then print the total time taken, and the             inputted values.
- tl;dr enter some numbers and big number go brrr

- Bad physics
- right click to spawn balls
- left click to drag and throw
- The acceleration is fucked - the collisions are also fucked. This was my first time using PyGame and a lot of the code is stolen and slapped together from various sources.

- Take on Daniel Shiffmans P5.js version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j86zuqqTlQ
- Quite frankly some of it is pretty sketchy but it is functional.
- I added left click to spawn more DVD logos for fun - and a toggleable FPS counter when you press 'v'

- Modified version of the ball physics thing I made the other day.
- Its like that old FB messenger soccer game that they removed.
- I might come back to this and finish it

# Rand_Number_Guesser.py
- Generates a number between 1 - 100
- Counts how many guesses you made
- Displays number and number of guesses taken to get it at the end - then prompts to play again
